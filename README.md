# AI-Healthcare-Workflow

**Mastering the AI Toolkit**  

---

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the application of the AI Development Workflow to a real-world problem. It covers all key stages from problem definition, data preprocessing, model development, deployment considerations, to ethical reflections and critical thinking.

The scenario focuses on building an AI system to predict patient readmission risk within 30 days of hospital discharge, incorporating ethical concerns and deployment challenges relevant to healthcare.
